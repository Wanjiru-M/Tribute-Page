                <h2><u>ABOUT</u></h2>
                <p>Dr Martin Luther King Jr. was America's most prominent civil rights activist, and many consider him to be the greatest American leader of the 20th century. 
                    His leadership was instrumental in the United States for ending legal apartheid and empowering the African-American community.
                     He was first and foremost a moral leader who advocated peaceful resistance as a way of bringing about political change, stressing that biblical values led by love would prevail over hate and fear-driven politics. 
                     He was a gifted orator, best known for his "I Have a Dream" speech delivered on August 28th 1963, at the March on Washington. 
 In 1968, he was killed by an assassin's bullet at the age of 39. Martin Luther King Jr.'s influence and legacy extended beyond the United States, affecting the fight against apartheid in South Africa. King is only one of three Americans and the only African-American to have a national holiday, which is observed on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which falls on the third Monday in January, close to his birthday.</p>
